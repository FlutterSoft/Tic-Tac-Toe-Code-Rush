# Tic Tac Toe Rushcode!
Just a super quick exercise to get a tic tac toe game functioning. It's not pretty.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was a rush practise to see how quickly I could code out the logic for a tic tac toe game. Is it pretty? No, but it works! Working with javascript is super fun. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

This definitely is not optimal. No objects were used. It was just basic arrays and functions with some dom manipulation. I'd rewrite it with objects and reduce code redundancy. 

## Lessons Learned:

Realised that when you add an event listener, if you add the function then and there it runs automatically. I had to use an anonymous function to get around this. The use of an array for the board worked well though.
